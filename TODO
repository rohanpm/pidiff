- Accurate file:line for plain objects
- file:line should be based on the symbols and not the objects (i.e. use AST)
- Log also prior location of symbol
- property appears as object, can/should we do better?
- Log also where something was exported from public API?
   e.g. in here:

    pidiff/_impl/diff/diff.py:61: N220 function added: set_disabled
    pidiff/_impl/diff/diff.py:58: N220 function added: set_enabled

  ... also produce non-_impl log message
- missing check for non-callable becoming callable?
